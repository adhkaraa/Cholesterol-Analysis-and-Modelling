# 🧬 Cholesterol Analysis and Modelling

This project focuses on building a **predictive model** to identify which health factors most influence total cholesterol levels. The dataset includes variables such as **systolic and diastolic blood pressure**, **BMI**, **fasting glucose**, and **triglyceride levels**.

## 📁 File

- `cholesterol-analysis.ipynb`  
  Jupyter Notebook containing the entire analysis process, including:
  - Data Cleaning
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Transformation
  - Model Building
  - Model Evaluation


## 🎯 Objective

To model and interpret the relationship between clinical health indicators and total cholesterol values, and to find which variables are the strongest predictors.


## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn


## 📌 Notes

- The notebook is written in **Bahasa Indonesia**.
- This project was completed as a part of a health data modeling exercise or coursework.


📌 *This project is intended for learning purposes in statistical modeling and health data analysis.*
